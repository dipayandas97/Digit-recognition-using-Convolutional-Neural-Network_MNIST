# Digit-recognition-using-Convolutional-Neural-Network_MNIST

Hand written numerical digit (28x28 pixel Grayscale) recognition using Deep learning, employing Convolutional Neural Network. 
It uses TensorFlow as the backend and Keras as the wrapper library. 
The dataset is downloaded from Keras.datasets as mnist

The network consists of:
-one convolutional layer of 30 5x5pixels kernals/filters
-one max pooling layer
-one dense layer of 125 nodes 
-and finally 10 nodes as output classes of digits from 0 to 9.
